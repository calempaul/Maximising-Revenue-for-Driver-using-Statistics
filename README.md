# Maximizing Revenue for Drivers ðŸš–  
**Analyzing the impact of payment methods on driver revenue using NYC Taxi Trip data**  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores the relationship between payment type and total fare amount, aiming to identify strategies that maximize driver revenue while maintaining a positive customer experience.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
- **Card payments dominate:** 65.9% of all transactions are made via card, compared to 34.1% with cash.
- **Higher fares with card payments:** Customers using cards tend to have longer trip distances and higher fare amounts.  
- **Passenger behavior matters:** Single-passenger rides make up 40.08% of all card transactions and 20% of all cash transactions.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** â€“ Filtered NYC Taxi Trip dataset to focus on relevant columns:  
   - Passenger count  
   - Payment type (Card/Cash)  
   - Fare amount  
   - Trip distance (miles)  
   - Trip duration (minutes)  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identified payment trends and revenue-driving factors.  
3. **Hypothesis Testing** â€“ Assessed the statistical significance of payment preferences on revenue.  


## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations  
âœ… Encourage card payments through discounts/incentives.  
âœ… Improve secure and seamless card payment options.  
âœ… Consider passenger count for pricing strategies.
